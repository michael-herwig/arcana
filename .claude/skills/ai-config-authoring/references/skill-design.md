## Anatomy

A skill is a directory whose entrypoint is `SKILL.md`: YAML frontmatter
between `---` fences, then a Markdown body. The directory name is the
skill's identity — `name` must match it exactly.

Portable frontmatter (the Agent Skills open standard):

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | 1–64 chars; lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens; must equal the directory name (grim also accepts periods as a superset — prefer hyphens for portability) |
| `description` | yes | 1–1024 chars; what the skill does + when to use it — see [descriptions.md](descriptions.md) |
| `license` | no | License name or pointer to a bundled license file |
| `compatibility` | no | ≤ 500 chars; environment needs — most skills do not need it |
| `metadata` | no | String-to-string map; the blessed extension point (author, version) |
| `allowed-tools` | no | Experimental; support varies by client — never depend on it |

Everything beyond these fields is vendor-specific. All major clients
ignore unknown frontmatter, so vendor fields degrade silently elsewhere —
never make correctness depend on a vendor field or on argument
substitution; in other clients placeholders render as literal text.

Bundled directories carry normative semantics:

- `scripts/` — executable code, run via the shell, never loaded into
  context (only output enters). Self-contained or with documented
  dependencies, non-interactive, with helpful error messages. Mark them
  black-box: "run with `--help` first; do not read the source."
- `references/` — documentation read on demand; one focused topic per
  file, named descriptively (`form_validation_rules.md`, not `doc2.md`).
- `assets/` — static resources used in *output*: templates, schemas,
  fonts, lookup tables.

No README — `SKILL.md` is the sole entrypoint.

## Size

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Hard ceiling | < 500 lines / < 5k tokens of body |
| Healthy median | ~250 lines — the official reference pack measures min 32 / median 254 / max 590 across 17 skills (as of 2026) |
| Thin pointer skills | ≤ ~130 lines, wrapping scripts |
| Metadata cost | ~100 tokens per skill, paid every session |

When approaching the ceiling, split: add a layer of hierarchy with clear
pointers. Do not compress prose into denser prose — density is not the
same as economy.

## Progressive Disclosure

Three loading levels: metadata (always) → body (on trigger) → bundled
files (on demand, effectively unlimited). Mental model: a well-organized
manual — table of contents, then chapters, then a detailed appendix.

- **Root as index.** SKILL.md is an overview that points to detailed
  material; quick-start inline, depth one level down.
- **One level deep, no chains.** Nested reference chains cause partial
  reads (`head -100`-style previews) and incomplete information.
- **TOC in big files.** Any bundled file over 100 lines gets a table of
  contents at the top so a partial read still reveals scope. (Official
  guidance says 100; some community packs use a looser 300 — adopt the
  stricter figure.)
- **Annotate every link** with what the file contains and when to load it:
  "For complete API details, read `references/api.md`."
- **Make execution intent explicit.** "Run `analyze.py` to extract
  fields" (execute) vs "Read `analyze.py` for the algorithm" (load).
- **Write standing instructions, not one-time steps.** Once invoked, the
  body persists for the session and is not re-read. Front-load critical
  rules — on at least one client, post-compaction only the first ~5k
  tokens per skill are re-attached (vendor-specific, as of 2026;
  re-verify).
- Relative paths from the skill root, forward slashes only.

## Discovery and Portability

The skill is the one artifact type every surveyed client hosts — rules and
agents are supported by roughly half each. Write one canonical `SKILL.md`
against the open standard and it is readable everywhere; only the directory
it must sit in changes (as of 2026; re-verify):

| Directory | Scanned by |
|---|---|
| `.claude/skills/` | [Claude Code][cc], also scanned by [OpenCode][oc] and [Copilot][cop] |
| `.agents/skills/` | the cross-vendor pool — see below |
| `<client>/skills/` | each client's own dir: `.opencode/`, `.github/`, `.cursor/`, `.kiro/`, `.junie/`, and one per newer client |

The pool is where portability actually pays off, and it is the one place
where **reading it and writing to it are different lists** — conflating
them is the usual mistake. [Codex][cx], [Gemini CLI][gem], [Zed][zed],
[Amp][amp] and [Goose][goose] point at `.agents/skills/` as their own
location. [OpenCode][oc], [Copilot][cop], [Cursor][cur] and [Warp][warp]
scan it *in addition* to a first-class directory of their own, so a tool
writing on your behalf will usually prefer the vendor-specific path and
treat the pool as an opt-in. And adoption is not universal: [Cline][cline]
documents `.cline/skills/`, `.clinerules/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`
with the pool named nowhere (as of 2026; re-verify each of these — this
list moves faster than anything else in this guide).

Two consequences worth designing for:

- **The shared pool is one copy with many readers.** A skill in
  `.agents/skills/` is visible to every client that scans the directory
  simultaneously — so a name collision there collides for all of them, and
  editing or deleting it changes what all of them see. The reader set keeps
  growing as clients adopt the convention, which only sharpens the point:
  unique, specific names matter more here than anywhere else. It also means
  "installed for one client" and "visible to one client" are not the same
  statement — never assume a pool skill is private to the client you
  installed it for.
- **Vendor frontmatter degrades silently.** All major clients ignore
  unknown frontmatter, so a client-specific field is dropped rather than
  rejected — never make correctness depend on one (see [Anatomy](#anatomy)).

## Eval-Driven Authoring

Build evaluations *before* writing extensive documentation. The loop:

1. **Find the gap.** Run the agent on representative tasks without the
   skill; record concrete failures.
2. **Write ≥ 3 eval scenarios** (query + input files + expected
   behavior), including should-NOT-trigger neighbors.
3. **Baseline** without the skill — proves the skill earns its tokens.
4. **Write the minimal instructions** that make the evals pass.
5. **Iterate with an author/tester split**: one agent instance authors
   and refines; a fresh instance runs the evals; feed observed failures
   back ("the tester skipped the filter step — is the rule prominent
   enough?").
6. **Test every model tier you target** — smaller models need more
   guidance, larger ones less.

Observe navigation during testing: an unexpected read order means the
structure is unintuitive; a bundled file that is never read is unnecessary
or badly signaled; a file read on every run should be promoted into the
body.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| Explaining what the model already knows | Default assumption: the model is already smart. Challenge every paragraph's token cost |
| Vague names (`helper`, `utils`, `tools`) | Specific, gerund-first names: `processing-pdfs` |
| Option overload ("use A, or B, or C, or…") | One default + one escape hatch |
| Voodoo constants (magic values without justification) | If you don't know the right value, the model can't determine it either — justify or remove |
| Time-sensitive content ("before August, use the old API") | Current instructions only; a collapsible legacy section if history matters |
| Scripts that punt errors back to the model | Handle errors in the script; verbose validator messages enable self-correction |
| Assuming packages are installed | State the install commands; verify availability per target environment |
| Inconsistent terminology (mixing "field" / "box" / "element") | Pick one term, use it everywhere |
| Body content that surprises users relative to the description | The body must do what the description promises — nothing hidden |
