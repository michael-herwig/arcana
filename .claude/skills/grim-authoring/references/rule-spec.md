# Rule Spec

You loaded this file because you are authoring or fixing a grim rule — a
single Markdown file, optionally with a sibling support directory — for
`grim build` or `grim release`.

## File Shape

A rule is one `.md` file. Frontmatter is **entirely optional** — a bare
Markdown file with no `---` fence is a valid rule whose body is the
whole document. The rule's name is the file stem, subject to the
universal name rules.

Rules have no `description` field. When grim needs one for the catalog,
it derives it from the first Markdown heading or first non-empty line —
so make the opening line carry meaning.

## Frontmatter

When present, all fields are optional; unknown keys are preserved
round-trip.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `paths` | list of strings | Glob patterns the rule auto-loads on; absent = always active |
| `summary` | string | **Top-level** — catalog blurb for `grim search` |
| `keywords` | string | **Top-level** — comma-separated tags (a YAML list is tolerated and comma-joined, but write the string form: it is the only shape valid in every kind) |
| `license` | string | **Top-level** — SPDX-style id (e.g. `Apache-2.0`); becomes the OCI license annotation |
| `authors` / `vendor` / `homepage` / `documentation` | string | **Top-level** — provenance and docs metadata. `vendor`/`homepage`/`documentation` are derived when omitted; `authors` never is, so author a team alias (see [catalog metadata][pub-metadata] and [the default set](./release-checklist.md#metadata-defaults)) |
| `repository` | string | **Top-level** — `https://` source URL, hard-gated at release |
| `deprecated` | string | **Top-level** — deprecation notice; non-empty marks the rule deprecated (flagged in search/TUI, warned on `add`) |
| `replaced-by` | string | **Top-level** — successor reference (independent of `deprecated`); surfaced in search / `grim describe`. Must parse as a reference or the release fails (exit 65) |
| `metadata` | string→string map | Vendor extensions only (e.g. `copilot.exclude-agent`) |

## The Asymmetry

Skills and agents put `summary`/`keywords`/`repository` inside their
`metadata` map. Rules put them at the **top level** of frontmatter;
`metadata` holds *only* vendor-namespaced keys. Swapping the conventions
is never an error — the keys are preserved as plain/unknown data and the
catalog silently never sees them. Check this first when a published rule
shows no summary in `grim search`.

`paths` is also top-level: it is a *common* capability every client
understands, not a vendor key ([common vs. unique][common-unique]).

## Support Directory

An index rule may carry extra context — examples, schemas, scripts — in
a sibling folder sharing its stem:

```
rules/
  my-rule.md     # the index you pass to build/release
  my-rule/       # optional support dir, same stem — auto-discovered
    examples.md
```

Both pack into one layer and install side by side (`rules/my-rule.md` +
`rules/my-rule/…`), so the index's relative links resolve on the
consumer. Support files are copied verbatim for every client — only the
index is ever transformed ([support directories][support-dir]). Claude Code
would auto-load that tree as unconditional context, so grim also excludes the
directory in the consumer's Claude settings; the files stay readable, only
the automatic load goes ([Claude support-directory exclusion][claude-excl]). The
[well-known assets][well-known] convention applies here too: a
`README.md` or `logo.png`/`logo.svg` inside the support directory is
where catalog UIs look for a readme or icon.

## Per-Client Transforms

Rules reach the fewest clients of any kind — a minority host them at all
and everyone else declines outright, which is why a skill is the portable
choice when the audience is broad ([client matrix][clients]). The same
published rule lands differently per client:

| Client | Transform |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | ~Verbatim — `paths:` is native frontmatter; re-rendered only when `metadata` carries vendor keys |
| Copilot | Written to `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md` at project scope (global scope lands in native `~/.copilot/instructions/`); `paths` comma-joined into a single `applyTo:` string; `copilot.exclude-agent` → `excludeAgent` |
| Cursor | Written to `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`; `paths` comma-joined into a single `globs` string plus a computed `alwaysApply: false` — unscoped emits no `globs` and `alwaysApply: true` |
| Kiro | Written to `.kiro/steering/<name>.md`; `paths` become a `fileMatchPattern` YAML **array** (not comma-joined) plus `inclusion: fileMatch` — unscoped emits `inclusion: always`. Global-scope scoping is upstream-inert today; grim writes the correct file and warns |
| OpenCode | Frontmatter **stripped** and `paths` dropped with a warning; body written with a provenance comment, preceded by a one-line prose notice restating the dropped scope (`> Applies only when working on files matching …`) so the model still gates on it; loading registered as a managed glob in `opencode.json` |
| Junie | **Degraded, project scope only.** Written to `.junie/rules/<name>.md` as provenance + the same prose scope notice OpenCode gets + body, with `paths` dropped and a warning — the directory is ownable, but every Markdown file in it is concatenated automatically with no per-file activation key. At global scope grim warns, skips, and writes nothing: no `~/.junie/rules/` exists upstream |
| Codex · Gemini · Zed · Amp · everyone else | **Declined** — no ownable path-scoped surface (always-on `AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` hierarchies, or a UI-managed surface with no on-disk path); grim warns, skips, and writes no file |

OpenCode never sees rule frontmatter at all — anything that must reach
OpenCode belongs in the body. Two authoring consequences of the rest:
Cursor splits its `globs` string on **every** comma, including one inside
a `{a,b}` brace alternation, so author `src/**/*.rs` and `src/**/*.toml`
as two patterns rather than `src/**/*.{rs,toml}`; and when the audience
is broad, a skill reaches every client a rule cannot — most of the fleet.

## Examples

Bare — no fence at all, still valid:

```markdown
# commit-style.md
Use Conventional Commits. Subject ≤ 50 characters.
```

Full — scoped, catalog-visible, with a vendor key:

```yaml
# rust-style.md
---
paths:
  - "**/*.rs"
summary: Idiomatic Rust style rules
keywords: rust,style,lints
repository: https://github.com/acme/rust-style
metadata:
  copilot.exclude-agent: code-review
---

# Rust Style

Prefer `&str` over `String` parameters...
```

## Validation Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Outcome |
|---|---|
| File stem violates name rules (`Bad_Name.md`) | Hard error, exit 65 — invalid name |
| `---` fence present but YAML malformed | Hard error, exit 65 — frontmatter parse |
| `repository` not `https://` | Hard error, exit 65 |
| Vendor key authored top-level (`copilot.exclude-agent:` outside `metadata`) | **Warning** — key is not projected ([example][rule-vendor-ex]) |
| `copilot.exclude-agent` outside `code-review`/`cloud-agent` | Hard error, exit 65 |
| `summary`/`keywords` placed inside `metadata` (skill-style) | No error — catalog silently shows nothing |
| Frontmatter carries both `name` and `description` | Warning — looks like an agent; did you forget `--kind agent`? |
