# Agent Spec

You loaded this file because you are authoring or fixing a grim agent —
a single `.md` defining a delegatable assistant — for `grim build` or
`grim release`.

## The #1 Pitfall

**`--kind agent` is required at build and release:**

```sh
grim build ./reviewer.md --kind agent
grim release ./reviewer.md ghcr.io/acme/reviewer:1.0.0 --kind agent
```

A bare `.md` path is indistinguishable from a rule by shape, and grim
never guesses from content — without the flag your agent **silently
packs as a rule**. This is not an error; the only signal is a warning
when a rule carries both `name` and `description`. Consumers need no
flag: `grim add` infers the kind from the published manifest's kind
metadata (the `com.grimoire.kind` annotation).

## File Shape

One `.md` file. Unlike rules, frontmatter is **required** — every client
needs at least a `description` to route work to the agent. The body
below the frontmatter is the system prompt and installs verbatim for
every client.

## Frontmatter

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Must equal the file stem (`reviewer.md` → `name: reviewer`); standard name rules |
| `description` | yes | When a client should delegate to this agent |
| `model` | no | Passed through verbatim — **no alias translation** between clients |
| `tools` | no | Comma-separated allowlist, projected per client (string vs. list) |
| `metadata` | no | Catalog keys (`summary`, `keywords`, `license`, `repository`, `deprecated`, `replaced-by`) **plus** vendor keys — agent catalog metadata lives inside `metadata`, like a skill |

## Vendor Overrides

`model` and `tools` are *defaults*. When a vendor key lifts to the same
native field, the vendor key wins **for that vendor — silently**; the
collision is the documented escape hatch:

```yaml
model: sonnet
metadata:
  claude.model: opus                            # Claude gets opus
  opencode.model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5   # OpenCode gets this
```

This matters most for `model`: Claude reads aliases like `sonnet`, while
OpenCode expects `provider/model-id`. Set `opencode.model` whenever the
common value is not OpenCode-shaped. Everything one vendor understands
(`claude.permission-mode`, `opencode.temperature`, `cursor.readonly`,
`gemini.temperature`, …) is a string key in `metadata` — registries are
linked from [vendor-metadata.md](vendor-metadata.md).

## Per-Client Emit

**Only a minority of clients host an agent at all** — decide up front
whether your audience is in that set:

| Client | Registry | Emit |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude.*` (richest) | The canonical format itself — a plain agent installs byte-identical, no provenance comment |
| OpenCode | `opencode.*` | Drops `name` (the filename is its identity) and drops `tools` with a warning (deprecated upstream in favor of `permission`) |
| Copilot | `copilot.*` | Emits `name`, `description`, `model`, and `tools` as a YAML list |
| Codex | `codex.*` | **TOML** (see below) |
| Cursor | `cursor.*` | Markdown frontmatter; the common `tools` has no equivalent and is dropped with a warning |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini.*` | Markdown frontmatter; Gemini loads agents only when its `experimental.enableAgents` setting is on (the default) |
| Antigravity | *(none yet)* | Markdown frontmatter; `tools` emitted as a YAML list (upstream types it `string[]`). The namespace is reserved but its agent registry is empty, so an `antigravity.*` key warns and drops |

Every emit but Claude's carries a provenance comment. **Every other
client declines agents** — no installable agent file format exists for
them, so grim warns, skips, and writes nothing. Their namespaces are
still reserved but carry **no populated registry for any kind**: such a
key hits an empty registry and is
warned + dropped, the same typo-guard outcome as a misspelt key in a
populated one.

Codex emits its TOML at `.codex/agents/<name>.toml`. The body becomes
`developer_instructions`; `name` and `description` map directly; `model`
is optional; `tools` is dropped with a warning. Its three keys —
`codex.model`, `codex.reasoning-effort` (`ultra` | `max` | `xhigh` |
`high` | `medium` | `low` | `minimal` | `none`), `codex.sandbox-mode`
(`read-only` | `workspace-write` | `danger-full-access`) — live in
`metadata` like any vendor key.

## Limitations

- **No object-valued vendor fields** — `metadata` is string-valued, so
  Claude's `mcpServers`/`hooks`, OpenCode's `permission`, and Copilot's
  `mcp-servers` cannot be authored; add them post-install.
- **No support directory** — an agent installs as exactly one file
  (`<name>.md`, or `<name>.toml` for Codex). A sibling directory sharing
  the stem is read **only** for the well-known companions `README.md`,
  `logo.png`, and `logo.svg`:
  those three ride the published layer (under `<name>/…`, for
  `grim fetch --path` and catalog UIs) but are never installed to a
  client; every other file in that directory is ignored
  ([well-known assets][well-known]).
- **No model translation** — see vendor overrides above.

## Minimal Example

```yaml
# reviewer.md
---
name: reviewer
description: Reviews a diff for correctness, style, and missing tests.
---

You are a code reviewer. Examine the diff...
```

## Validation Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Forgetting `--kind agent` | **Not an error** — packs as a rule; grim warns only that the rule looks agent-shaped |
| No frontmatter at all | Hard error, exit 65 — frontmatter is required for agents |
| Missing `name` or `description` | Hard error, exit 65 — frontmatter parse |
| `name` ≠ file stem | Hard error, exit 65 — name mismatch |
| Known vendor key, bad literal (`claude.permission-mode: yolo`) | Hard error, exit 65 — publish stops |
| Typo'd own-namespace key (`opencode.temprature`) | Warning + dropped |
| Sibling dir sharing the stem | Only `README.md`/`logo.png`/`logo.svg` pack (catalog companions, never installed); everything else silently ignored |
| Vendor key shadowing a common field | Silent override per vendor — a feature, but a surprise when unintended |
| `repository` not `https://` | Hard error, exit 65 |
